Control Theory Problems by Reinforcement Learning, OpenAI Gym and Policy Gradient

The Reinforcement Learning flavor of the learning problem is strikingly similar to how humans effectively behave â€” experience the world, accumulate knowledge and use the learnings to handle novel situations. 

Policy gradient methods are a type of reinforcement learning techniques that rely upon optimizing parametrized policies with respect to the expected return by gradient descent. They do not suffer from many of the problems that have been marring traditional reinforcement learning.
